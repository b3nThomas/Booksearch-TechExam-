Elsevier Technical Test - Log:

Brief
In a language of your choice create a web application
which uses the attached JSON Graph as a data store.

The application should provide at least the following
capabilities and provide a suitable foundation for
other developers to enhance and improve upon in the
near and distant future.

-   A display of all the product titles

-   The ability to search for a product based on product title

We suggest that you host your application in AWS and use GitHub
for source control as you will be required to demonstrate your solution
and talk through the code which youâ€™ve implemented. Additionally an
Elsevier employee will need to be granted access to view the application
and source code before this demonstrate

If you believe it is necessary you are invited to enhance your
solution by implementing additional functionalities which you
feel would be useful for a company such as Elsevier

1. Learn how to use the data from a JSON file in JS. This way
I can start trying to pull parts of the data. (Starting point)

Renamed JSON file. (content.json)
Trying to understand the data in the file is very difficult.
http://www.w3resource.com/JSON/structures.php

JSON is a Value/String based data structure of Objects and Arrays.
From what I understand, "worksById" contains the main chunk of
product information, "doisByID" contains further info about the chapters
and the vectors are related to a search engine somehow as the reference
specific products based on what appears to be keywords.

2. Created Amazon Web Services Account
Was planning on building on HTML, CSS, JS. Quick bit of research first:
What is the difference between a web application and website?
Answer: Not much! If it's dynamic then it's okay.


3. GOAL: Get JS and JSON talking via HTML hosted on AWS.
For the product names, I think need access to worksById.title.titleText
